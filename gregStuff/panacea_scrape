DrDankBud;2014-10-28;Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large &quot;critical mass&quot; of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high. It was rated 4 out of 5, Good to Very Good.This plant has lots of crystals and deep red hairs all over the flower. The smoke is strong and the high kicks in immediately.All parcels are shipped within 24 hours of the order being received. A tracking number is placed on all parcels, but for security reasons we do not share the number. If you parcel has not arrived in a reasonable time frame, please send me a message and we will check the tracking and status.
TheBestCannabis;;Two grams (2g) of the finest quality medical grade BHO, properly purged and produced using organic buds and trim. BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F. This means that if you eat the oil right out of hand without heating it any first, it will have more medicinal properties than get-you-high properties.
TheBestCannabis;;These are the flowers that never make it to the top shelf because they are almost always kept by the grower.The best buds money can buy.Current strain available is True OG.Pictures:http://postimg.org/gallery/3c8l2u8us/f332c182/
