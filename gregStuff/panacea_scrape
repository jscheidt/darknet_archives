It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1415491200",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1415491200",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1415491200",

The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz.   This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays.  It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth.  The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut.  The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1415491200",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1415491200",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1415491200",

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect.

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1422316800",

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.

The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.

It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.  It makes the sativa side better (removes some potential jitters without draining the energy) and also enhances the wonderful body buzz that is great for aches and pains.","1421020800",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421020800",

This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in.

If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension.

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect. This is the perfect stuff for relaxing after a hard day at work and when smoked in higher quantities a guarantee for a narcotic effect like a soporific.Brand: Strain HuntersGenetics: 70% Indica / 30% SativaParents: Original Master Kush x (Hindu Kush x Skunk)Flowering Time: 8 weeksTHC: HighCBD: UnknownYield (indoor): HighYield (outdoor): 1000 g/plantHeight Indoor: ShortHeight Outdoor: Short","1423699200",

"panacea","angeleyes","Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup".

Anything else is easy as pie - this variety is versatile and easy to grow. It performs perfectly in both hydro and soil and a ScrOG and SOG set-up and requires only very little maintenance. Special Queen #1 produces weed with a THC level of 14-16% and a long lasting and body relaxing effect.Special Queen #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is a Sativa dominant variety, but it has a pretty short flowering time of only 8 weeks (some growers reported they harvested after 7 weeks, but we highly recommend to give it that extra week - outdoors it is ready for plucking the crop at the end of September). Indoors one can expect a yield of 500-650 g/m² (now imagine a 4 meters plant outdoors, loaded with buds - can you estimate THAT yield? Unfortunately it is not is not suitable for northern European climates like The Netherlands, Germany or Great Britain, but, who knows?

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/4 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1423699200",

If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

"panacea","angeleyes","Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain.  I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.  I'd put it more specifically of course ;).  The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath.  This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user.  It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain.  We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment.  I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.  It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.  I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.","1423699200",

This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup".

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.

Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests.

If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your chocolate it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly (or 3/4 of a container of chocolate). It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in.

I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like little else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension.

"panacea","angeleyes","Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.-----","1423699200",

An absolute, all time bestseller of the Dutch coffeeshops and winner of numerous cannabis awards throughout the years. Stable genetics, easy to grow and causing an outstanding high - just what marijuana should be like.ROYAL QUEEN SEEDS - WHITE WIDOW: GROW YOUR OWN LEGEND AND ENJOY ONE OF THE BEST CANNABIS EVERThough as with every legend, the precise genetics of the Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is not known exactly, most sources say about a refined Brazilian Sativa and an exquisite Indica hybrid from India. The smoke brings back memories of the classical, old-school ganja, with a fresh taste and instant kick.Cultivated indoors, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow can reach from 80 to 100 cm and yield up to 400 g per square meter. Outdoor plants can grow as high as 2 meters and yield some 100 g apiece. At approximately 9 weeks it has an average flowering period, during which you can expect formation of tempting buds of the best quality marijuana. Thanks to decades worth of world's top breeders efforts, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is exceptionally easy to take care of, making the joy of growing it higher still.Cannabis Cup awards:","1423699200",

That is a serious question as these plants reach a height of 150cm indoors - outdoors you will find her towering at a height of 3 meters (some growers reported plants of 4m+!). Anything else is easy as pie - this variety is versatile and easy to grow. It performs perfectly in both hydro and soil and a ScrOG and SOG set-up and requires only very little maintenance. Special Queen #1 produces weed with a THC level of 14-16% and a long lasting and body relaxing effect.Special Queen #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is a Sativa dominant variety, but it has a pretty short flowering time of only 8 weeks (some growers reported they harvested after 7 weeks, but we highly recommend to give it that extra week - outdoors it is ready for plucking the crop at the end of September).

Critical Automatic goes from seed to harvest in just 9 short weeks.ZAMNESIA SEEDS - CRITICAL AUTOMATIC: READY IN JUST 9 WEEKSA hybrid of intense flavour and distinction, Critical Automatic from Zamnesia Seeds packs in the very best of the Critical cannabis, into what can be best described as autoflowering package. By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace. In the short space of 9 weeks she is capable of yielding 70-80g per plant if not more (depending on conditions).","1423699200",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Two grams (2g) of the finest quality medical grade BHO, properly purged and produced using organic buds and trim. BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F. This means that if you eat the oil right out of hand without heating it any first, it will have more medicinal properties than get-you-high properties.","1423699200",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

Critical Automatic goes from seed to harvest in just 9 short weeks.ZAMNESIA SEEDS - CRITICAL AUTOMATIC: READY IN JUST 9 WEEKSA hybrid of intense flavour and distinction, Critical Automatic from Zamnesia Seeds packs in the very best of the Critical cannabis, into what can be best described as autoflowering package. By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace. In the short space of 9 weeks she is capable of yielding 70-80g per plant if not more (depending on conditions).","1423699200",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo. Fourteen months after participating in the study, 94% of those who received the drug said the experiment was one of the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives; 39% said it was the single most meaningful experience.

This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1420502400",

The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1420329600",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421884800",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421884800",

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.  I'd put it more specifically of course ;).  The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath.  This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user.  It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain.  We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment.  I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.  It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.  I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.","1421884800",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421884800",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417824000",

With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high. It was rated 4 out of 5, Good to Very Good.This plant has lots of crystals and deep red hairs all over the flower.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417824000",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417824000",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis. Great for depression, pain and stress.","1414800000",

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect. This is the perfect stuff for relaxing after a hard day at work and when smoked in higher quantities a guarantee for a narcotic effect like a soporific.Brand: Strain HuntersGenetics: 70% Indica / 30% SativaParents: Original Master Kush x (Hindu Kush x Skunk)Flowering Time: 8 weeksTHC: HighCBD: UnknownYield (indoor): HighYield (outdoor): 1000 g/plantHeight Indoor: ShortHeight Outdoor: Short","1423094400",

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1423094400",

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.  I'd put it more specifically of course ;).  The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath.  This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user.  It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain.  We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment.  I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.  It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.  I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.","1423094400",

Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/8 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1423094400",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Ingredients: Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, whey, lecithin, vanillin, psilocybin cubensis mushrooms.This is by far the tastiest way to enjoy magic mushrooms.Hazelnuts and cocoa are blended with a small amount of skim milk and vanilla to produce a light, fluffy, and creamy spread that tastes like heaven.The subtle addition of finely powdered organic cubensis mushrooms makes this a chocolate experience to remember.50g of chocolate spread will contain 10mg of psilocybin, or the equivalent of about two grams of my whole dried mushrooms.The chocolate is packaged in a non-toxic, BPA-free, PVC-free, latex-free container intended for baby food. Freezer and microwave safe.The flavors of mushroom and chocolate go together like nothing else does, and everyone who tries a fingerful of this chocolate instantly has their face light up with joy.Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursIt is strongly recommended to consume this on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your chocolate it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly (or 3/4 of a container of chocolate). It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero your first time.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like little else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

"panacea","angeleyes","Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.-----","1423094400",

Stable genetics, easy to grow and causing an outstanding high - just what marijuana should be like.ROYAL QUEEN SEEDS - WHITE WIDOW: GROW YOUR OWN LEGEND AND ENJOY ONE OF THE BEST CANNABIS EVERThough as with every legend, the precise genetics of the Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is not known exactly, most sources say about a refined Brazilian Sativa and an exquisite Indica hybrid from India. The smoke brings back memories of the classical, old-school ganja, with a fresh taste and instant kick.Cultivated indoors, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow can reach from 80 to 100 cm and yield up to 400 g per square meter. Outdoor plants can grow as high as 2 meters and yield some 100 g apiece. At approximately 9 weeks it has an average flowering period, during which you can expect formation of tempting buds of the best quality marijuana. Thanks to decades worth of world's top breeders efforts, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is exceptionally easy to take care of, making the joy of growing it higher still.Cannabis Cup awards:","1423094400",

That is a serious question as these plants reach a height of 150cm indoors - outdoors you will find her towering at a height of 3 meters (some growers reported plants of 4m+!). Anything else is easy as pie - this variety is versatile and easy to grow. It performs perfectly in both hydro and soil and a ScrOG and SOG set-up and requires only very little maintenance. Special Queen #1 produces weed with a THC level of 14-16% and a long lasting and body relaxing effect.Special Queen #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is a Sativa dominant variety, but it has a pretty short flowering time of only 8 weeks (some growers reported they harvested after 7 weeks, but we highly recommend to give it that extra week - outdoors it is ready for plucking the crop at the end of September).

Critical Automatic goes from seed to harvest in just 9 short weeks.ZAMNESIA SEEDS - CRITICAL AUTOMATIC: READY IN JUST 9 WEEKSA hybrid of intense flavour and distinction, Critical Automatic from Zamnesia Seeds packs in the very best of the Critical cannabis, into what can be best described as autoflowering package. By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace. In the short space of 9 weeks she is capable of yielding 70-80g per plant if not more (depending on conditions).","1423094400",

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F.

By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace.

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo. Fourteen months after participating in the study, 94% of those who received the drug said the experiment was one of the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives; 39% said it was the single most meaningful experience.

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417737600",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416700800",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1416700800",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416700800",

The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416700800",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416700800",

However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM!

AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects.

The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz.   This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays.  It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth.  The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut.  The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417392000",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417651200",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416787200",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416787200",

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect.

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/8 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1422748800",

"panacea","angeleyes","Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup".

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1419724800",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419724800",

That is a serious question as these plants reach a height of 150cm indoors - outdoors you will find her towering at a height of 3 meters (some growers reported plants of 4m+!). Anything else is easy as pie - this variety is versatile and easy to grow. It performs perfectly in both hydro and soil and a ScrOG and SOG set-up and requires only very little maintenance. Special Queen #1 produces weed with a THC level of 14-16% and a long lasting and body relaxing effect.Special Queen #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is a Sativa dominant variety, but it has a pretty short flowering time of only 8 weeks (some growers reported they harvested after 7 weeks, but we highly recommend to give it that extra week - outdoors it is ready for plucking the crop at the end of September). Indoors one can expect a yield of 500-650 g/m² (now imagine a 4 meters plant outdoors, loaded with buds - can you estimate THAT yield? Unfortunately it is not is not suitable for northern European climates like The Netherlands, Germany or Great Britain, but, who knows?

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421452800",

"panacea","SAGreat1","Dinachem by Dinafem     (EXCLUSIVE TO PANACEA)Grown from seed indoors.Very little of this stuff due to the size of this plant being very small so first in will guarantee there chance of trying this strain.Nice strain but i found the taste of the bud a little "chemically" which is strange as the plant was flushed for 1 week prior to harvest.-INFORMATION-Dinachem is the latest version of the mythical elite clone ChemDog, in the seed form.To reproduce and enhance its vigor, we have used an original clone and we have crossed it with a select clone of Guava Chem, injecting new energy and vigor, yet preserving its delicious flavor of authentic original ChemDog.The ChemDog has an incredible pedigree, it is the mother of NYC Diesel, Sour Diesel and OG Kush. It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416268800",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1416268800",
"panacea","SAGreat1","Girl Scout Cookies By Cali Connection (thin mint pheno)Grown indoor from seed.The worlds most popular strain by many that holds countless 1st 2nd and 3rd cannabis cups and you will know why when you see and smoke it.This GSC from cali connection has a mint pheno which you can smell but it is very mild.-INFORMATION STRAIN-Cannabis Genetics?Original Thin Mint Pheno from Clone-Only Girl Scout CookiesFlowering Time?8-9 weeksSativa / Indica ratio?Fairly Balanced MixYield?AverageHeight Info?mediumFlavour?Just Like Thin Mint Cookies - Google It!HIGH TIMES REVIEW!Strain Lineage: OG Kush x GDP x DurbanThe first cannabis strain dynasty likely appeared in the mid 1980s with the emergence of �Skunk #1� and its offspring. Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416268800",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416268800",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416268800",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416268800",

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis. Great for depression, pain and stress.","1417478400",

The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz.

The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417478400",

Effects may take up to two hours to begin and last for as many as eight hours.If you do end up eating more than you should, just drink some water and calm down. Cannabis has never killed anyone and it's not going to kill you.","1417478400",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419897600",

"panacea","DrDankBud","Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high. It was rated 4 out of 5, Good to Very Good.This plant has lots of crystals and deep red hairs all over the flower.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419897600",

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1419897600",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419897600",

Effects may take up to two hours to begin and last for as many as eight hours.If you do end up eating more than you should, just drink some water and calm down.

"panacea","SAGreat1","Dinachem by Dinafem     (EXCLUSIVE TO PANACEA)Grown from seed indoors.Very little of this stuff due to the size of this plant being very small so first in will guarantee there chance of trying this strain.Nice strain but i found the taste of the bud a little "chemically" which is strange as the plant was flushed for 1 week prior to harvest.-INFORMATION-Dinachem is the latest version of the mythical elite clone ChemDog, in the seed form.To reproduce and enhance its vigor, we have used an original clone and we have crossed it with a select clone of Guava Chem, injecting new energy and vigor, yet preserving its delicious flavor of authentic original ChemDog.The ChemDog has an incredible pedigree, it is the mother of NYC Diesel, Sour Diesel and OG Kush. It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416009600",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1416009600",
"panacea","SAGreat1","Girl Scout Cookies By Cali Connection (thin mint pheno)Grown indoor from seed.The worlds most popular strain by many that holds countless 1st 2nd and 3rd cannabis cups and you will know why when you see and smoke it.This GSC from cali connection has a mint pheno which you can smell but it is very mild.-INFORMATION STRAIN-Cannabis Genetics?Original Thin Mint Pheno from Clone-Only Girl Scout CookiesFlowering Time?8-9 weeksSativa / Indica ratio?Fairly Balanced MixYield?AverageHeight Info?mediumFlavour?Just Like Thin Mint Cookies - Google It!HIGH TIMES REVIEW!Strain Lineage: OG Kush x GDP x DurbanThe first cannabis strain dynasty likely appeared in the mid 1980s with the emergence of �Skunk #1� and its offspring. Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416009600",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416009600",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416009600",

Silver HazeSativa haze, MrNice/Shantibaba2 week cureThis strain, sometimes known as the "queen of sativas" has a fantastically cerebral high that stimulates thinking and reflection, and in higher doses is quite psychedelic. As a sativa I'd be surprised if it weren't energizing, and it doesn't disappoint, but its energy is fully available to the task at hand, not being lost or wasted on secondary thoughts and impulses. This Silver Haze has the clearest head of any strain I've ever smoked and it enhances the dominant voice in one's head and can help resolve indecisiveness or clarify internal conflict. Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to. I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly. Not with Silver Haze. After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high. I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.One of our favorite breeders classifies Hazes as ranging from "nicely centered to full-blown trippy/psychedelic." This Silver Haze pheno is what I'd call nicely centered in that unless you abuse it you will feel like you are well in control. He also says of Mr Nice's Hazes that "with the high ceiling, low build up tolerance and long lasting high they always satisfy." That's most certainly true. Its a wonderful strain for smoking all day because the burnout factor is very low and you can top up the high with a couple more hits and it really puts you back where you started.","1416009600",

Silver HazeSativa haze, MrNice/Shantibaba2 week cureThis strain, sometimes known as the "queen of sativas" has a fantastically cerebral high that stimulates thinking and reflection, and in higher doses is quite psychedelic. As a sativa I'd be surprised if it weren't energizing, and it doesn't disappoint, but its energy is fully available to the task at hand, not being lost or wasted on secondary thoughts and impulses. This Silver Haze has the clearest head of any strain I've ever smoked and it enhances the dominant voice in one's head and can help resolve indecisiveness or clarify internal conflict. Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to. I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly. Not with Silver Haze. After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high. I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.One of our favorite breeders classifies Hazes as ranging from "nicely centered to full-blown trippy/psychedelic." This Silver Haze pheno is what I'd call nicely centered in that unless you abuse it you will feel like you are well in control. He also says of Mr Nice's Hazes that "with the high ceiling, low build up tolerance and long lasting high they always satisfy." That's most certainly true. Its a wonderful strain for smoking all day because the burnout factor is very low and you can top up the high with a couple more hits and it really puts you back where you started.","1416009600",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416009600",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1417219200",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1417219200",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419984000",

With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419984000",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419984000",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects.

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today.

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1415232000",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1415232000",

Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to. I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly. Not with Silver Haze. After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high. I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.One of our favorite breeders classifies Hazes as ranging from "nicely centered to full-blown trippy/psychedelic." This Silver Haze pheno is what I'd call nicely centered in that unless you abuse it you will feel like you are well in control. He also says of Mr Nice's Hazes that "with the high ceiling, low build up tolerance and long lasting high they always satisfy." That's most certainly true.

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416441600",

With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high.

The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1416441600",
"panacea","SAGreat1","Girl Scout Cookies By Cali Connection (thin mint pheno)Grown indoor from seed.The worlds most popular strain by many that holds countless 1st 2nd and 3rd cannabis cups and you will know why when you see and smoke it.This GSC from cali connection has a mint pheno which you can smell but it is very mild.-INFORMATION STRAIN-Cannabis Genetics?Original Thin Mint Pheno from Clone-Only Girl Scout CookiesFlowering Time?8-9 weeksSativa / Indica ratio?Fairly Balanced MixYield?AverageHeight Info?mediumFlavour?Just Like Thin Mint Cookies - Google It!HIGH TIMES REVIEW!Strain Lineage: OG Kush x GDP x DurbanThe first cannabis strain dynasty likely appeared in the mid 1980s with the emergence of �Skunk #1� and its offspring. Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416441600",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416441600",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416441600",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects.

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416441600",
"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis. Great for depression, pain and stress.","1416441600",

It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.  It makes the sativa side better (removes some potential jitters without draining the energy) and also enhances the wonderful body buzz that is great for aches and pains.","1420934400",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1420934400",

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

It has about 15% THC, 70% Indica/30% Sativa.This plant has smaller leaves and big heavy buds that have long white hairs covering the plant. It is great for getting happy, relaxed and uplifted. It will also make you hungry.All parcels are shipped within 24 hours of the order being received. A tracking number is placed on all parcels, but for security reasons we do not share the number.

It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.  It makes the sativa side better (removes some potential jitters without draining the energy) and also enhances the wonderful body buzz that is great for aches and pains.","1419206400",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM!

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421280000",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1418601600",

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.","1418601600",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1418601600",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1418601600",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416528000",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1416528000",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416528000",

"panacea","angeleyes","The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz.   This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays.  It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth.  The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut.  The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness.  The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)","1416528000",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416528000",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1416528000",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1415664000",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1415664000",

"panacea","DrDankBud","Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high. It was rated 4 out of 5, Good to Very Good.This plant has lots of crystals and deep red hairs all over the flower.

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1415923200",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1415923200",

Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1415923200",

Its buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come. A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately, stimulating both conversation and creativity."From my personal experience smoking some of this excellent weed from my garden, it was wild.

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1415923200",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1415923200",

Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to. I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly. Not with Silver Haze. After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high. I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.One of our favorite breeders classifies Hazes as ranging from "nicely centered to full-blown trippy/psychedelic." This Silver Haze pheno is what I'd call nicely centered in that unless you abuse it you will feel like you are well in control.

If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in.

If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension.

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect. This is the perfect stuff for relaxing after a hard day at work and when smoked in higher quantities a guarantee for a narcotic effect like a soporific.Brand: Strain HuntersGenetics: 70% Indica / 30% SativaParents: Original Master Kush x (Hindu Kush x Skunk)Flowering Time: 8 weeksTHC: HighCBD: UnknownYield (indoor): HighYield (outdoor): 1000 g/plantHeight Indoor: ShortHeight Outdoor: Short","1423440000",

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup".

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/4 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1423440000",

If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

By drawing on the best experiences in hybridizing Haze strains on both sides of the Atlantic, Royal Queen Seeds breeders managed to cross the classical American Haze with its more modern Dutch cousin.

"panacea","angeleyes","Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain.  I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.  I'd put it more specifically of course ;).  The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath.  This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user.  It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain.  We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment.  I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.  It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.  I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.","1423440000",

This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/8 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.

Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests.

If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your chocolate it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly (or 3/4 of a container of chocolate). It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero your first time.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like little else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension.

"panacea","angeleyes","Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.-----","1423440000",

An absolute, all time bestseller of the Dutch coffeeshops and winner of numerous cannabis awards throughout the years. Stable genetics, easy to grow and causing an outstanding high - just what marijuana should be like.ROYAL QUEEN SEEDS - WHITE WIDOW: GROW YOUR OWN LEGEND AND ENJOY ONE OF THE BEST CANNABIS EVERThough as with every legend, the precise genetics of the Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is not known exactly, most sources say about a refined Brazilian Sativa and an exquisite Indica hybrid from India. The smoke brings back memories of the classical, old-school ganja, with a fresh taste and instant kick.Cultivated indoors, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow can reach from 80 to 100 cm and yield up to 400 g per square meter. Outdoor plants can grow as high as 2 meters and yield some 100 g apiece. At approximately 9 weeks it has an average flowering period, during which you can expect formation of tempting buds of the best quality marijuana. Thanks to decades worth of world's top breeders efforts, Royal Queen Seeds feminized White Widow is exceptionally easy to take care of, making the joy of growing it higher still.Cannabis Cup awards:","1423440000",

That is a serious question as these plants reach a height of 150cm indoors - outdoors you will find her towering at a height of 3 meters (some growers reported plants of 4m+!). Anything else is easy as pie - this variety is versatile and easy to grow. It performs perfectly in both hydro and soil and a ScrOG and SOG set-up and requires only very little maintenance. Special Queen #1 produces weed with a THC level of 14-16% and a long lasting and body relaxing effect.Special Queen #1 by Royal Queen Seeds is a Sativa dominant variety, but it has a pretty short flowering time of only 8 weeks (some growers reported they harvested after 7 weeks, but we highly recommend to give it that extra week - outdoors it is ready for plucking the crop at the end of September).

Critical Automatic goes from seed to harvest in just 9 short weeks.ZAMNESIA SEEDS - CRITICAL AUTOMATIC: READY IN JUST 9 WEEKSA hybrid of intense flavour and distinction, Critical Automatic from Zamnesia Seeds packs in the very best of the Critical cannabis, into what can be best described as autoflowering package. By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace. In the short space of 9 weeks she is capable of yielding 70-80g per plant if not more (depending on conditions).","1423440000",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Two grams (2g) of the finest quality medical grade BHO, properly purged and produced using organic buds and trim. BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F. This means that if you eat the oil right out of hand without heating it any first, it will have more medicinal properties than get-you-high properties.","1423440000",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo.

Critical Automatic goes from seed to harvest in just 9 short weeks.ZAMNESIA SEEDS - CRITICAL AUTOMATIC: READY IN JUST 9 WEEKSA hybrid of intense flavour and distinction, Critical Automatic from Zamnesia Seeds packs in the very best of the Critical cannabis, into what can be best described as autoflowering package. By combining Critical with that of a Ruderalis, the expert cultivators were able to develop a feminized strain that is easy-to-grow, high yielding and potent in effect. Fans of the original Critical will be just as satisfied with this autoflowering version (if not more).Thanks to Critical Automatic resilient nature, novice growers will have no problems getting to grips with it. The mix of sativa and indica genetics make for a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds filled with resin.In terms of its medical properties, Critical Automatic is great at helping to treat a wide range of ailments including chronic pain, sleeping disorders, stress, anxiety, muscle spasms not to mention a whole host of other symptoms.Although small in stature (growing to around 60cm to 80cm tall), Critical Automatic has a wide and open structure which allows for more light to reach the plant; which in turn results in bigger and better harvests. Speaking of harvests, this feminized phenom produces at lightning quick pace. In the short space of 9 weeks she is capable of yielding 70-80g per plant if not more (depending on conditions).","1423440000",

"panacea","TheBestCannabis","Grown with the same love and care as my cannabis products, using only organic materials. Mushrooms will be packaged and shipped carefully and discretely, make sure to see my profile for all other relevant information before ordering.Onset : 10 - 40 minutes (when chewed and held in mouth)Onset : 20 - 60 minutes (when swallowed on empty stomach)Duration : 2 - 6 hoursNormal After Effects : up to 8 hoursHigher resolution photos: (click to enlarge)http://postimg.org/gallery/418nzdps/1b18309f/These are well dehydrated immediately after picking, and then sealed away for freshness. This impacts the taste a lot, and most people actually find these at least "not unpleasant" to eat right out of hand.It is strongly recommended to eat them on an empty stomach. If you eat a big plate of pasta right before you eat your mushrooms it will strongly delay and potentially greatly reduce the effects of the psilocybin.Approximately one in ten people will experience slight nausea around 30 minutes after consuming, but this is largely an overblown issue and when it does occur it is usually because people are just really expecting the nausea, and eat some when they are nervous about it. Don't be nervous, worst case scenario you feel queasy for a couple minutes, it's not a big deal.The appropriate dosage is something you will need to feel out for yourself, as it is different for everyone. A general guideline for a "medium-strong" level experience, is to take 1g per 100 pounds of body weight. So a 150lb person would take 1.5g, roughly. It is always recommended for new or inexperienced users to take a smaller dose (perhaps 0.5g per 100lbs) and also, to split their dose in half. Weigh out how much you are going to take, then eat half and wait to eat the other half until you feel the first half kick in. Don't try to be a hero.Set and setting is VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT for mushroom trips. I have never had a bad trip, and I have never been with anyone who had a "bad trip," because I don't put myself in bad trip settings. What are your fears? What things are bothering you right now? Questions like these are important to know the answer to before doing any serious psychedelic, including mushrooms. If you are claustrophobic, and try to do mushrooms in an enclosed indoor space, you may have a bad time. If you have social anxiety and you try to do mushrooms around people you have never met before, you might have a bad time. If you secretly resent your roommate and have never told them, doing mushrooms with them might be a bad time.If you are UNSURE of where to go when taking mushrooms, GO OUTSIDE. The farther the better. Bring ample food, water, and friends (optional), and go far outside. I have never once in my life, having given mushrooms to thousands of people, ever heard or seen anyone have a bad time on mushrooms while outside. They go together like nothing else in life does, and one of the primary values of mushrooms as a psychedelic tool is allowing you to more easily immerse yourself in and appreciate the natural world, and therefore yourself and everything else around you by extension. Mushrooms will allow you to truly get a new perspective on your current thoughts, life, feelings, and body, in a way that is not possible otherwise.Recommended reading for interested parties:Erowid:https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtmlWhat do magic mushrooms do to the brain?http://mic.com/articles/102724/scientists-have-discovered-why-magic-mushrooms-are-so-magical"Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioral biology at Hopkins, performed a study that involved 18 healthy adults, average age 46, who participated in five eight-hour drug sessions with either psilocybin � at varying doses � or placebo. Fourteen months after participating in the study, 94% of those who received the drug said the experiment was one of the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives; 39% said it was the single most meaningful experience.

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1416960000",

It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1416960000",

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F. This means that if you eat the oil right out of hand without heating it any first, it will have more medicinal properties than get-you-high properties.","1416960000",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1420070400",

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow.

"panacea","angeleyes","Now on sale for the holiday season, we've dropped the price of our Kali Mist from $160/half to $120.  This sale will continue until the new year.Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.","1418342400",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1418342400",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1422057600",

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect.

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1422057600",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1422057600",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/8 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain.

The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1422057600",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow.

We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1418947200",

It can't be beat for its incredibly balanced head and body high.  Its an indica sativa blend, with very special qualities on both sides. This cure has a deliciously strong sweet and fruity aroma/taste and imparts an active head high that makes the world sparkle and fills the smoker with a wonderfully controlled energy and confident mood.  The body buzz is strong and definitely gets you stoned, but without the tired feeling of many strong body-highs.  It won't couch-lock you, or make you dizzy or dumb, and the high lasts a good long time.The UV dried version of this strain is the one we sell.

However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us.

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1420675200",

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F.

"panacea","DrDankBud","AK47 XTRM - seeds from Amsterdam Marijuana SeedsHere is the description from AMS:"For many years Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds has been searching to find the ultimate AK47. After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419379200",

"panacea","DrDankBud","Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity. THC levels of this strain may reach 19-22%.Reviews from Leafly.com: http://www.leafly.com/indica/critical-mass, say this is a strong and powerful plant with a long lasting body high. It was rated 4 out of 5, Good to Very Good.This plant has lots of crystals and deep red hairs all over the flower.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419379200",

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1419379200",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1419379200",

"panacea","DrDankBud","Critical Mass is a combination of Afghani and Skunk #1 that originated from the breeder Mr. Nice Seed Bank. With a large "critical mass" of production, branches tend to snap from the weight of these dense buds. Flowering time is approximately 6-8 weeks, with a heavy leaf to flower ratio. However, due to the large production of flowering, this strain is susceptible to mold which can be reduced by growing indoors to reduce humidity.

I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling.  I'd put it more specifically of course ;).  The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath.  This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user.  It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain.  We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment.  I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra.  It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique.

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1421712000",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for a 1/4 ounce each of ChemdawgXG13 and the Big Lebowski. These strains contrast very well. The Chemdawg is an energetic "daytime" smoke, while the Lebowski is a mellow and relaxing hybrid strain that's great for socializing and kicking back. Blended, you get the best of both, with the Lebowski anchoring your body and the Chemdawg providing motivation and energy.**************************************Chemdawg x G13 - Traditional Dried, UV DriedSativa, Dr Greenthumb2-3 week cureChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high with a potential mellow body buzz (if UV-dried) that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow and dry normally feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas (though lighter smokers start slow). It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We have both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its far secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, but still retains a lot of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety, though it does appear the UV finally does coax out expression of the G13 indica base because you can get very nice pain relief and a marvelously meditative high with the UV-dried.**********************The Big Lebowksi (2-3 week cure)Indica/sativa blend.Over the years, pot has gotten a lot stronger, especially with the advent of indoor hydroponic growing under metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps. The Big Lebowksi is a kind of a throwback to a mellower time before industrialized pot production. The Big Lebowksi is a happy, hazy high with a sweet sativa head and beautiful and stress-melting body buzz. This strain is strong but it takes it easy with you in a way that many indoor strains don't nowadays. It has a citrus spice taste that softens with a longer cure and is very smooth. The Lebowski is a cross between Blueberry and the Cinderella99 Pineapple cut. The C99 Pineapple is a true classic sativa that transports you to mellow yellow-land with a dreamy smile on your face, and Blueberry is one of the most famous classic pain-relieving strains around.The UV-dried version of this strain really brings out the medicinal pain relieving Blueberry indica goodness. The traditional dried version we refer to as the "classic" Lebowski."Classic Big Lebowksi" (2-3 week cure)This version of our popular Big Lebowski strain was not dried with UV light, unlike our regular offering. This is the strain as we first sold it and as many of us here at Angel Eyes prefer it. Without the UV the C99 sativa side really comes out and is a more psychedelic and potent version of the plant, though the basic character remains the same.","1415318400",

"panacea","angeleyes","Chemdawg x G13 Traditional or UV-DriedSativa, Dr GreenthumbChemdawg, (sativa-dominant 80/20) and G13 (indica-dominant 80/20), both classic strains, combine to give this cross a truly energizing and soaring high combined with a mellow body buzz that is unusual for such a strong sativa (while G13 is technically classified as indica-dominant, the phenotype of this cross we grow feels like a true sativa). The combination of these two strains works very well because, unlike many high THC strains that cause a racy, paranoid feeling, this phenotype keeps you grounded with its warm buzz while your head goes soaring into the stratosphere. Its a very clean and clear high with heightened visual perception and shimmering, and avoids the heart-racing/paranoia-inducing tendency of many commercial sativas. It imparts an active and interested motivation, is great for socializing and enhances conversation and thought. Its excellent genetics and pungent, Chemdawg (pungent, spicy diesel) aroma and taste are hard to beat.We sometimes offer both traditionally dried and UV-dried varieties. The traditional is a very clear headed, up high. Great morning smoke or when motivation or energy is required. There is a mild body buzz but its secondary to the head.The UV-dried version of this strain has more depth, more of a body buzz, and is more relaxing, but still retains much of the clarity and energy of the traditional dried variety.","1415318400",

As a sativa I'd be surprised if it weren't energizing, and it doesn't disappoint, but its energy is fully available to the task at hand, not being lost or wasted on secondary thoughts and impulses. This Silver Haze has the clearest head of any strain I've ever smoked and it enhances the dominant voice in one's head and can help resolve indecisiveness or clarify internal conflict. Its really great for motivation and work, and while you can kick back and relax on it, you probably won't want to. I've noticed with a lot of pot that physical activity can wear out a high quite quickly. Not with Silver Haze. After an hour and a half of exercise I was still happy and high. I would say the strain is a well balanced combination of euphoric and creative and provides an exciting high.One of our favorite breeders classifies Hazes as ranging from "nicely centered to full-blown trippy/psychedelic." This Silver Haze pheno is what I'd call nicely centered in that unless you abuse it you will feel like you are well in control. He also says of Mr Nice's Hazes that "with the high ceiling, low build up tolerance and long lasting high they always satisfy." That's most certainly true.

The Strain Hunters welded the genes of Master Kush (a High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s), Hindu Kush and Skunk into one variety to create this very potent remedy that effectively treats insomnia, pain, tension and lack of appetite.Money Maker is suited for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems and in all environments she requires only 8-9 weeks of flowering to produce up to 1kg (per plant, respectively per square meter). The produced compact buds consist of densely packed large calyxes and the extreme amount of resin glands make them look as if they have been glazed. The massive fruits can become so heavy, that you will need to come up with some kind of support for the branches to prevent them from bending and breaking. Money Maker has a very high calyx-to-leaf ratio, making her even more appealing to commercial growers because the post-harvest work is done in a snap.The large buds have a berry-sweet aroma, but with earthy and spicy components. The smoked Money Maker weed has a nutty, spicy and fruity flavor with an aftertaste slightly reminding of garlic and induces an intense physical effect.

Populating the plant's surface are hard dense buds that brim with flavor and aromatic promise- a real treat for the senses.This Indica-Sativa specimen is not only blessed with beauty but with power, pace and spectacular performance too - flowering in as little as 50-55 days. Surprisingly, even though Purple Pinecone measure in a rather puny 0.5-0.7 meters, she manages however to produce a substantial stack of cannabis. Grown under the right conditions, you can expect her to yield in the region of 327-375g/m² of top notch weed.Purple Pinecone induces a stunningly strong Indica stone, one that embraces you with both intensity and kindness. The ideal pot for relaxing with some chilled out tunes, or perhaps in the company of some friends.","1422489600",

"panacea","angeleyes","This listing is for an 1/8 ounce each of Kali Mist and Kosher Kush.**********************Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration. We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow. A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi. It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant. The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps. Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time. The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains. A truly amazing strain.Kali Mist won the Cannabis Cup twice and placed once: 1995 - 1st place "Hydro Cup", 2000 - 1st place "Sativa Cup" &amp; 2002 - 3rd place "Sativa Cup". In our opinion the awards are well-earned.**********************Kosher Kush (Reserva Privada)(traditionally dried)This is my first attempt at a strain description for this strain. I'll be augmenting it over the next few months as we get more familiar with it and hear feedback from customers.I now get why people say Kosher Kush can provide a blessed feeling. I'd put it more specifically of course ;). The Kosher has an insistently energetic high that centers in the chest and works with a rising feeling through the chest and upper arms that pulses in sync with each breath. This rising feeling, coupled with the clarity and gentle but insistent motivation of the high, can produce a "grateful" or awakened feeling in the user. It really has a beautiful high, and one that is surprisingly active for an indica strain. We have yet to UV any of these buds because we wanted to familiarize ourselves with them as they come off the plant first, but this strain already displays some solid pain relieving properties that should be even more pronounced with a UV treatment. I was expecting at least some couch lock with this strain as it is known as very solid for insomnia, and its possible that with a higher dose than my usual 6-10 hits off a jay it might have that effect, but so far I couldn't discern it.The first batch we're offering is from the likely mother plant we are calling Sierra. It has a pungent, spicy, a little sour but also sweet aroma that is very complex and unique. I'd say out of our stable the closet high is the Grape Bogglegum, but this is definitely a high that has staked out its own territory, and I will be experimenting with it quite a bit over the coming months.Kosher Kush won the High Times Indica Cup in 2010 and 2011.-----","1422489600",

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F.

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today.

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1418774400",

This sale will continue until the new year.Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.","1418774400",

(Critical Afghan is being regrown to try and get some cutting as we only had 1 successful cutting).We had 2 Critical Mass females that were successfully pollinated by our Sour Diesel male, one of which turned into a male, the other is what we have listed today, she developed small buds which our original Sour Diesel developed but what stood out was the white frostiness that our original Sour Diesel developed in its mid stage of flowering whilst the Critical Mass mother held that tight bud cluster that improves the Sour Diesel's dry bud per sq metre by around 60%.We will have very limited of this in stock as we are planning to turn majority of it into oil, we expect to run out in the first 2 weeks.Any questions feel free to PM us,","1418774400",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1418774400",

Ask anyone over 40 if they remember the old school Skunk and their eyes will light up as they start to delve into memories of the smells and flavors of roadkilll skunk and sweaty socks.Due to law enforcement, disease, and lord knows what else, the Skunk family lost its title. In the 90s, the reign of the Chemdog strain dynasty that still dominates all markets today began.As legend goes, a man referred to as Chemdog received a sample of some amazing herb at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado sometime in the early 90s and later ordered some of this herb out to the east coast where he lived. Twelve seeds were found in the bags that Chemdog ordered and from those seeds legends have been born, most notably: Sour Diesel, OG Kush, Chem 4 and Chem 91.The Chem family stands alone as the current world champions of cannabis today. In order to even be considered on the level of the Chem family, a strain must come swinging with equal amounts of flavor and potency, yet most cannot keep up with the burst of fresh lemons from a proper OG or the soaring wonderful high of a Sour Diesel. Therefore, the �family� demands the highest market prices in the United States. From Los Angeles to New York City, the �family� has been the taster�s choice desired by rappers, movie stars and grandparents alike.A very smart breeder in the San Francisco Bay Area discovered the missing link of a sweet member to the Chem family by introducing the cannabis world to �Girl Scout Cookies�.A brilliant cross between OG Kush and Cherry Pie (GDP x Durban) GSC balances flavor and potency, carving a niche in the cannabis world for those who prefer the more grapey and sweet flavors. This particular sample of Girl Scout Cookies, provided by Capitola Healing Association, epitomizes the potential of this strain: a sweet burst of grapes and nag champa with baked cookies, followed by an OG Kush lemon back and high.Living up to its name, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar. GSC posses an amazing high with a hard-to-reach ceiling, this attribute may be the leading cause to the hype surrounding this strain.Girl Scout Cookies takes a little while to master in an indoor situation as she can be a low yielder if not properly trained or grown in a sea of green style. But, she has potential to do much better once dialed in.This particular sample was grown with General Hydroponics as a nutrient base and was tested at a 28 percent THC level, an astronomical number for any strain.","1418774400",

After many, many requests we expanded our search and went to our master breeder Relaximo for advise. Where normal seedspecialists draw the line, Relaximo continues..After much thinking, travelling, testing, breeding and more testing, Relaximo gave us the best of both worlds! However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47. Finally one day our man, with a scruffy beard, a huge smile and a tear of happiness, came outside. Stoned out of his mind, he brought us the wonderful news: �The AK47 XTRM! " Here's your love!" the seeds master roared!By merging the two excisting strains, Relaximo had given us the AK47 XTRM! He made some corrective growth selections to ensure a better plant figor and stem to bud ratio and finally stabilized her into this wonderful cannabis plant.With this awesome, flavorful, strain a very special species arose, that grows steadily and under the right conditions will soon produce tops no less than 20 percent larger than its little sister, the AK47! This of course applies only to the AK47 XTRM regular and feminized .. not for the Autoflowering!! Due to its high level of indica, this plant makes for an ideal medicinal strain. The AK47 XTRM brings a devine high with a tingling touch.Relaximo has proven himself once again. Without him the world would not have been as glorious as it is today. Since there is no AK47 as perfect as our AK47 XTRM!"75% indica, 25% sativa. Up to 24% THC!!According to leafly.com, http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/ak-47, the AK47 description is as follows, "Don't let the scary name fool you: AK-47 will leave you relaxed and mellow. This sativa-dominant hybrid delivers a steady and long-lasting cerebral buzz that keeps you mentally alert and engaged in creative or social activities. AK-47 mixes Colombian, Mexican, Thai, and Afghani varieties, bringing together a complex blend of flavors and effects. While AK-47�s scent is sour and earthy, its sweet floral notes can only be fully realized in the taste."This is just as it's described. Enjoy this wondeful, calming, happy and uplifting cannabis. Great for depression, pain and stress.","1420156800",

It´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.The clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.We found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.The GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.It looks very much like the original clone, available in seed, which allows us to keep genetics for a long time and also select the best to cross with the mother.We have to acknowledge the participation in this project of the legendary breeder and creator of the strain, ChemDog, which has contributed with Guava Chem seeds and the elite clone.From this batch of seeds we selected the most stable plants and best quality to cross them with the original clone.Dinachem´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away. It´s an unique taste, pungent and fragrant, like lemon mixed with petroleum and a hint of pine leaves.Dinachem EffectPowerful, pleasant and relaxing.Highlighting its capacity for pain and anxiety.Moreover stimulates the appetite powerfully.All these features make it desirable for both, recreational and medicinal use.There is an extended believe, about this strain, that expresses its full potential when grown with chemical fertilisers, which we deny.In the hands of experienced growers and cultivated by biological means is simply delicious.Dinachem is a complex project made possible thanks to the work of many people in two continents, we hope you like it :)Sex: FeminizedSativa/indica (65-35%)GuavaChem x Original Chemdawg 91Indoor flowering: 60 daysOutdoor harvest: Mid-OctoberIndoor yield: 500 g/m2","1420156800",

BHO stands for Butane Honey Oil, and is widely recognized as one of the purest and most effective cannabis concentrates.This BHO can be eaten, smoked, vaporized, made into a drinkable tincture, or applied topically. Great for skillet-type vape pens made for waxes and oils, but needs to be mixed with vegetable glycerin in order to work in wick-based vape pens.Current batch is a blend of both Sativas and Indicas and is decarboxylated to about 200 degrees F.

"panacea","angeleyes","Now on sale for the holiday season, we've dropped the price of our Kali Mist from $160/half to $120.  This sale will continue until the new year.Kali Mist (Serious Seeds)SativaKali Mist is a long-blooming almost pure sativa (90%) with an incredible spicy aroma and a super-potent high that in larger doses may need a safe space for further exploration.  We're not alone in thinking that smoking marijuana affects the flow of chi through the body, and that its use for pain relief is intricately tied in with that flow.  A Kali Mist high makes the body and head positively vibrate with flowing chi.  It radiates out from the heart to the head and arms, body to feet, in pulsating waves, making pain fuzzy and distant.  The gossip surrounding this strain is that Kali was specially developed by a group of breeders as a pain relieving strain especially for women's menstrual cramps.  Its reportedly well up to that task, and while we don't feel our experience gives us authority to say this is true or not for the average woman, we can say its got the most amazing body high we've ever experienced, all without muddying the head or making us tired.The soaring high is inspirational in higher doses, and at low doses the head is clear and ready for action while the body feels strong and relaxed at the same time.  The comedown is almost non-existent with none of the discomfort or sullenness of inferior strains.  A truly amazing strain.","1419033600",

However, since our expert was not impressed with the yeild and quality of the excisting AK47, he crossbred it with our superior White Widow XTRM strain.And so Relaximo locked himself in a space that was not to be entered by any of us. And there he lived like a hermit, on bread and water, all with the purpose of creating the worlds ultimate AK47.
