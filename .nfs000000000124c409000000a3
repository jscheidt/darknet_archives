Dry and chalk-like texture that is resistable to bad moisture effects.  Pure snow white in color.  Mild coke smell when you first pop the baggie open.  Smells good and clean.EFFECTS ON COMMON USER: Euphoric, Uppity / Energetic, Social High.  Mellow as far as coke goes.  Not too racy/jittery/freezy jaw effect.  Easy comedown after night is over.  No crazy fiending feeling afterwards.TASTE &amp; DRIP: Light, pleasurable tasting drip.  Not over-bearable.  Smooth on nose.PURITY / QUALITY / CUTS: EZTest Purity Results: turns muddy brown color very quickly indicating solid purity.  Somewhere between the 3rd and 4th top EZTest colors.

Quality, top shelf stock.  Great for those who love the rocket fuel effect and the long benders  This is a much more overpowering flavor of coke compared to our classic.  Certain types of users expect this type of coke as they do not want any mellow-ness to their cocaine.  Hard to say this is any better or worse than our classic A+ coke.  Just different.  And technically – purity is higher.BATCH CONSISTENCY: Slight Consistency Differences from batch to batch – The purity and rocket-fuel effect is consistent from batch to batch.  Appearance and effects slightly differ.  Our profile will note new batches that are worth mentioning batch differences.  Its hard to update dozens of listings so please give our profile update section a glance if you want to check on potential new batch info / pic links, etc.  Any MAJOR changes will result in a new listing with new product name.APPEARANCE &amp; TEXTURE &amp; SMELL: Softer chunks with little bit of powder in original form.  Oily to the touch.  Off-white to dull yellow hues in color.  Hard coke smell when you open the baggie that would make most experienced coke users happy to smell this familiar smell (hard to describe).EFFECTS: Rocket fuel!  Potent energetic stuff with high fast peaks.  Comedown is manageable but that fiending feel is noticeable.  Jaw clenching may occur.  Try to go easy with this stuff.  But good for those who like a good coke bender / long rager.  This will keep you going for sure.TASTE &amp; DRIP: Noticeable distinct drip familiar to experienced users – tastes good, not too overbearing drip.  Nose is okay for at least 4-6 hours of regular use.  But can start getting harsh on nose after that.  Some batches are more / less noticeable on the nose harshness.PURITY / QUALITY / CUTS: EZTest Purity Results – turns muddy brown quickly.  Somewhere between the mid to high 4th color range indicating 60-80% purity.  Some batches come out a little on darker end but fairly consistent.  Pics will be posted in profile links for major changes in purity results.  No noticeable cuts so a neutral light cut is used.  Nothing dangerous for sure.  We are going to start publishing pics of cut test results soon.*************** ****************************************************************************VENDOR OVERVIEW: USA domestic vendor providing consistent, predictable, top-notch service to domestic USA &amp; international buyers.

It is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats, lipids and waxes. This can result in over 80 percent THC. However, it also means that terpenes are lost in the process.Budder retains more of the terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent – with THC percentages in the 70s. It has a creamy consistency from being whipped.Oil tends to be the least refined of the three. It is a gooey, sticky liquid that can be hard to handle. This form – also known as honey oil or butane hash oil – can retain a full flavor profile, however, THC levels tend to be less consistent.CLEARNET SOURCE: http://www.hightimes.com/watch/concentrate-basics-shatter-budder-and-oil","1425772800"
